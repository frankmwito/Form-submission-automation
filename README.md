# AJAX Web Form Automation

## Overview
This project focuses on automating the testing of dynamic web forms that utilize AJAX for form submission. The primary objective was to validate input handling, error scenarios, and seamless integration into a CI/CD pipeline to enhance testing efficiency and reliability.

## Tools Used
- **Selenium WebDriver** â€“ For automating form interactions.
- **pytest** â€“ For structuring and executing test cases.
- **Faker** â€“ For generating realistic test data.
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ For automating test execution in CI/CD pipelines.
- **Jenkins** â€“ For continuous integration and deployment.

## Scope
- **Dynamic Form Interaction**: Handling AJAX-based form submissions.
- **Validation Testing**: Ensuring proper error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Verifying successful submission of valid data.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Running automated tests in GitHub Actions and Jenkins.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reducing testing time by **30%** through reusable test scripts.
- **HTML Report Generation**: Creating structured reports for debugging.

## Key Achievements
- Automated form validation and submission testing.
- Improved test efficiency and coverage through **CI/CD pipeline integration**.
- Reduced testing execution time by **30%**, improving feedback cycles.
- Implemented structured **HTML reports** for easier debugging and issue tracking.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- pytest
- ChromeDriver (or appropriate WebDriver for the browser being tested)
